### About me
Highly qualified specialist in RPA with strong computer science background and experience in OpenText Content Server development.

In recent years, I have noticed that it is more interesting for me to write code than to develop on RPA platforms.
Previously, I had experience in back-end development on the OpenText platform, now I want to try myself in the front-end part.
